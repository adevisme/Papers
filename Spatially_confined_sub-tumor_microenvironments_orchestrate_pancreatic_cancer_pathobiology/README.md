## Abstract

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains resistant to most treatments and demonstrates a complex pathobiology. Here, we deconvolute regional heterogeneity in the human PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME), a long-standing obstacle, to define precise stromal contributions to disease progression. Large scale integration of histology-guided multiOMICs profiling with clinical data sets and functional in vitro models uncovered two microenvironmental programs in PDAC that were anchored in fibroblast differentiation states. These sub-tumor microenvironments (subTMEs) co-occurred intratumorally and were spatially confined, producing patient-specific cellular and molecular heterogeneity associated with shortened survival. Each subTME was uniquely structured to support discrete aspects of tumor biology: reactive regions rich in activated and inflammatory fibroblast communities were immune-hot and promoted aggressive tumor features while deserted regions enriched in extracellular matrix supported tumor differentiation yet were markedly chemoprotective. In conclusion, PDAC regional heterogeneity derives from biologically distinct reactive and protective TME elements with a defined, active role in PDAC progression.
